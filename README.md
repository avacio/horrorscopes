### Contributions Breakdown
- alexis
  - [VIS-NODES]
    - add node size information to legend
    - node size different options global scale or local depending on type?
    - ICEBOX (would be nice):
      - sort options for cyclic view?
      - start order of zodiac from the top? instead of at 0 degrees

### Team Process
|   | Weak | Satisfactory | Good | Excellent | What are specific actions you want to take to address issues|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Team has a clear vision of the problem(s)  | | | | X | We were able to talk to Zipeng this week about our concerns regarding design and scope through TA office hours, and it was very helpful |
| Team is properly organized to complete task and cooperates well |   |   |  | X | Looks like we are on track to complete our visualizations! |
| Team managed time wisely |  |  | X |  | We could have a more efficient pipeline, but we are definitely working on it for next milestone.|
| Team acquired needed knowledge base  |  |  |  | X | From force simulation, to customized map hybrids, and data parsing, we learned what we needed to know |
| Efforts communicated well within group  |   |   |   | X| Through online group chats and periodic video calls |
